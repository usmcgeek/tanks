# Middle Earth CCG Set Editor Custom

* Custom Fork of Magic Set Editor to support high resolution export and creation
* Added Support for TANKS TableTop Skirmish Game
* Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/usmcgeek/meccg/wiki/MECCG-Set-Editor:-Getting-Started) for guides and tips!
* Looking for the cards? The remastered repo is [here](https://github.com/usmcgeek/mer)

## Notes:
 * Note - while this is compatible with normal magicseteditor, you will not get full resolution with the normal one.
   Use the editor here for full resolution support. Regular magicseteditor forces everything down to 150dpi max.
 * Simply run the application from the directory.  Or move it all and run.
 * All game and style files are in the \data\ subdirectory
 * Make sure to install fonts
 * The game files for the data directory are updated often with improvements.
 * Cards, Photoshop design files, resources, and the completed Set files are all hosted at the other repo, usmcgeek/mer

## Features
 * Check "Set Fields" for options
 * Auto card numbering will add card numbers by name. Format is 001/001 (number/total)
 * Spell check added, and custom dictionary to match Tolkien words (quotes cause error atm)
   To control spell check, use the "mark errors" option.
 * Added support for French, German, and Spanish spell check dictionaries
 * Auto-replace to add special characters (fix Dunadan, Nazgul, etc, automatically)
 * Promo Icon field added
 * Easily add a Card set icon (like the DC team does)
